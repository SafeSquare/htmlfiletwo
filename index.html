        <h1>The King of European football</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The 37 years old Portuguese striker has achieved a lot both on and off
          the pitch, from his dribbling skills, striking ability, un-matched
          jump power to his wealth, fame and titles. Here are some things you
          should know about this living legend.

      <h3>Early life</h3>
      <p>
        Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of
        Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in
        the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth and youngest child
        of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis
        Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man. Ronaldo grew up in
        an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his
        father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In
        1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed
        him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to
        Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play
        semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to
        focus entirely on football. While popular with other students at school,
        he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said
        had "disrespected" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with
        tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing
        football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to
        cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart
        rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and
        resumed training a few days later.

      </ul>
      <p>
        At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team
        manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He
        subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
        under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a
        single season. A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his
        debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored
        two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.

        Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the
        player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan
        Laporta. Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo,
        met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible
        transfer.

        <li>Manchester United [2003-2009]</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too
        late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against
        Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him
        the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made
        him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football
        history.

        Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received
        the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United
        players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the
        number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.A key element
        in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of
        whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most
        important and influential factors in my career."

        On 10 July 2018, two icons of the European and football world came
        together - Cristiano Ronaldo became a Juventus player. Today, after
        three years together and 133 appearances, 101 goals scored and five
        trophies won, that chapter has come to an end
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        In August, Juventus reached an agreement to sell the Portuguese player
        to Manchester United for €23 million (£19.6m, $26m), including €8m
        linked to the achievement of specific performance objectives.
